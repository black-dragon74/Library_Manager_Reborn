Library Management suite with Salt Encryption Based on Java+MariaDb(Also MySQL is supported)

Just download the project and import the SQL file in your MySQL or MariaDb database.

You will be asked to activate the software first.

Activation code is "Activate_Software" (Exclude the quotes)

In case you are locked out default Unlock code is "Unblock_Software" (Without Quotes)

In case any problems or doubts ask me on my signoff email i.e. nickk.2974@gmail.com

Will try and add Bcrypt, World's most secure encryption algorithm (working on it's API as of now)

Program is still in BETA but 100% bug and loopholes free

I have kept it in beta because i have hell lot of things to work on UNDER THE HOOD, That includes code optimizations and some more algorithms.
